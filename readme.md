# Commit Club

The first rule of Commit Club is obviously that you do not talk about Commit Club. No talking, no chats, no slacks, no emails, no GitHub comments.

One repo, two people, taking turns at pushing one commit at a time. Doesn’t matter when. Doesn’t matter if it’s a lot of work — or just a tiny edit. The point is to keep building. Something. Anything.

So what happens with a project like this? With absolutely no plans — and no communication on the project, apart from our commit messages and stuff we push… Will the project die quickly due to a complete lack of direction? Or will we actually build something?

I have no idea. This is an experiment. The first draft of this readme is the initial commit by @elisabethirgens. Now it’s your turn @deestan.
